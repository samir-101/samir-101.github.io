The efficiency and safety of automotive vehicles are significantly influenced by the tire pressure.
It is crucial to ensure that the proper tire pressure is upheld as it plays a significant role in
enhancing traction on the road, improving fuel consumption efficiency, and extending the overall
lifespan of the tires. In this research, we delve into the analysis of power consumption with speed
at different pressure and loads for the development of an innovative Automatic Tire Pressure
Control (ATPC) system. This system can meticulously craft the purpose of consistency of
regulating and sustaining the optimal tire pressure levels across a spectrum of diverse driving
conditions. The primary focus of our study revolves around investigating the profound effects
that this advanced ATPC system exerts on the traction capabilities of the vehicle as well as its
power consumption metrics. To achieve a comprehensive understanding, our research
methodology encompasses a blend of rigorous theoretical analysis coupled with hands-on
practical experimentation.
