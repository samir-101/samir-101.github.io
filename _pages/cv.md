## 🛠️ PROJECTS AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### [Development of an Automatic Tire Pressure Control (ATPC) System and its Effect on Vehicle Traction and Fuel Consumption](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iNI-V1l6DehH5ZcdmpnFVV2dkClprvOQ/view)
* Undergraduate Thesis, Under Supervision of Prof. Dr. Md. Ehsan
* Focuses on developing an Automatic Tire Pressure Control (ATPC) System to optimize tire pressure for various road conditions, thereby reducing fuel consumption and increasing vehicle traction. The system analyzes fuel efficiency and tire traction with varying pressure, load, and speed, providing insights for the ATPC systems' feasibility.

### [tRIPSy - Sound source localizing Tri-Copter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tXarRvlcISoc6RGFWB3vM04zui4ryN8G/view)
* ME-366-Electromechanical System Design Project, Under Supervision of Dr. Kazi Arafat Rahman
* A ROS enabled Tri-Copter with ReSpeaker 4 mic-array and Raspberry Pi 3 for noise detection and Localization. I designed a custom 3D printed body and programmed the Pixhawk 4 flight controller with Ardupilot and PID tuned for stability and direction control. WiFi Telemetry was implemented with MAVlink to control from ground station.

### Haptic Feedback Based Race Collaboration System for Hearing Impaired Athelets
* ESP-32 and NRF24L01 Based Low Latency Communication System to synchronize races by providing Haptic feedback to the hearing impaired patients.

### [Thermosyphon CPU Cooler - Modelling, Manufacturing and Performance Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Ucxixpvbj619Z12TBDaqCh59sum6sWt/view)
* ME-310-Thermo Fluid System Design Lab Project
* A natural convection cooler was designed and manufactured using copper and brass alloys and its effectiveness was analyzed for upto 80W heating load using a Peltier Module.
 Mathematical modelling was done using MATLAB and verified with the experimental results.

### PID Based Low Temperature Heater for Medical Application
* Arduino Nano, Thermistor and Ceramic Heater Based Low Temperature Heating Device to provide localized heat to patients.

### [Rabindra-GPT](https://github.com/samir-101/rabindra-gpt)
* Just a experimental GPT-2 Model clone trained on Rabindranath Tagore's Essay works dataset. Based on Andrej Karpathy's Building GPT From Scratch code
