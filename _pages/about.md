Hi,  
I’m **Samir Hassan**, a Mechanical Engineer with a Bachelor’s degree from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/), graduating with a **CGPA of 3.43 (out of 4.00)**. My research interests lie in **Control Theory, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems**.  

Currently, I work as a **Machine Learning and Embedded Systems Engineer** at [Therap BD Ltd.](https://therapbd.com/) where I focus on:  

- **Computer Vision** and **Activity Recognition**  
- **Deployment of ML models on edge devices** (e.g., Nvidia Jetson)  
- **Firmware development** for microcontrollers  
- **Design and development of piezoresistive sensors**  

During my undergraduate studies, I was an active member of [Team Interplanetar](https://buetinterplanetar.com/the-team-2024/), BUET’s university rover team, where I served as **Electrical and Communications Sub-Team Lead**.  
Our team developed an autonomous rover capable of performing complex tasks and participated in:  

- **European Rover Challenge (ERC)**, Poland (On-site, 2022)  
- **University Rover Challenge (URC)**, USA (2023)  

My key contributions included:  

- Designing and implementing a **robust power system** with voltage and current sensing capabilities  
- Developing a **Brushless DC traction system with FOC control**  
- Implementing **hall-sensor-based positional feedback** for arm autonomy  

For my undergraduate thesis, I worked on the **automobile sector**, where my team developed a **testing setup** to investigate the correlation between tire pressure and power consumption under varied loads.  
Our work provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of **Automatic Tire Pressure Control Systems (ATPC)** in improving traction and fuel efficiency.  

In the **Electro-Mechanical System Design** course, my team and I developed an **autonomous ArduCopter-based tri-copter** equipped with a 4-microphone array and flight computer for detecting and identifying sources of sound pollution.  
We implemented **MAVLink communication** between the flight computer and ground station to enable smooth path planning using ROS.  

I am a quick learner and passionate about solving complex problems at the intersection of **mechanical systems, electronics, and intelligent control**.  I love to work in **hands-on environments**, enjoy building and testing real systems, and am excited to contribute to the future of **robotics and autonomous systems** through innovation and practical implementation.
