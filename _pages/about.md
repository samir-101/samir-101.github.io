Hi,  
I’m **Samir Hassan**, a **Mechanical Engineering Graduate** from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/), with a **CGPA of 3.43/4.00**. My **GRE score** is **320** (167 Quantitative, 153 Verbal and 3.5 Writing) and my **IELTS score** is **7.5**.

My research interests include **Control Theory, Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, Autonomy, and Multi-Agent Systems**.

Currently, I work as a **Machine Learning and Embedded Systems Engineer** at [Therap BD Ltd.](https://therapbd.com/) where I worked on:  

- **Activity Recognition** with **Computer Vision** related projects
- **Automatic Sound Recognition(ASR), Speech TO Text(STT)**
- **Deployment of ML models on edge devices** (e.g., Nvidia Jetson, Raspberry Pi)  
- **Firmware development** for microcontrollers (STM32, ESP32) 
- **Design and development of piezoresistive sensors**  

Alongside, During my sophomore year I founded [PrintOType BD](https://www.facebook.com/printotypebd/), a 3D printing and CAE consultancy startup. Using a FDM 3D printer, I have helped university students and research teams prototype and fabricate parts for academic and engineering projects. 

Few of my research projects are experiences are-
* During my undergraduate studies, I was an active member of [Team Interplanetar](https://buetinterplanetar.com/the-team-2024/), BUET’s university rover team, where I served as **Electrical and Communications Sub-Team Lead**.  
Our team developed an autonomous rover capable of performing complex tasks and participated in:  
  - **European Rover Challenge (ERC) 2022, Poland**(4th in Remote and 8th On-site)
  - **University Rover Challenge (URC) 2023, USA**  

  My key contributions included:  
    - Designing and implementing a **robust power system** with voltage and current sensing capabilities  
    - Developing a **Brushless DC traction system with FOC control**  
    - Implementing **hall-sensor-based positional feedback** for arm autonomy  
    - Oversawing the **additive manufacturing (FDM Printing)** of Rover parts

* For my undergraduate thesis, I worked on the **Development of an Automatic Tire Pressure Control (ATPC) System and its Effect on Vehicle Traction and Fuel Consumption**, where my team developed a **testing setup** to investigate the correlation between tire pressure and power consumption under varied loads. We logged the tire speed using tachometer, Power consumption of the Induction Motor using a 3 Phase Power Analyzer and Pressure Gauge to measure tire Pressure. Our work provided meaningful insights into the effectiveness of **Automatic Tire Pressure Control Systems (ATPC)** in enhancing traction and fuel efficiency.

* In the **Electro-Mechanical System Design** course, I developed an **autonomous Sound Source localizing Tricopter** equipped with a 4-microphone array and flight computer for **DoA and SSL** of sound pollution using Raspberry Pi 3 and Open embeddeD Audition System Library. The frame was designed and built using Aluminum Extrusions and FDM 3D Printing. We implemented **MAVLink communication** between the flight computer and ground station to enable smooth path planning using **ROS**.

I am a quick learner and passionate about solving complex problems at the intersection of **mechanical systems, electronics, and intelligent control**.  I love to work in **hands-on environments**, enjoy building and testing real systems, and am excited to contribute to the future of **robotics and autonomous systems** through innovation and practical implementation.
