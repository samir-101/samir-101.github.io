Hi, 
I'm Samir, a Mechanical Engineer currently working as a Machine Learning and Embedded System Engineer at [Therap BD Ltd](https://therapbd.com/). Here I mostly work on Computer Vision, Deployment of ML models in edge devices (e.g Nvidia Jetson), Activity Recognition, Firmware for MCU and Development of Piezo Resistive Sensors.

I graduated from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology(BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/) with a CGPA of 3.43 (Out of 4.00). My research interest lies on Control Theory, Robotics and Autonomous Systems.

During undergraduate studies I was a member of the university rover team [Team Interplanetar](https://buetinterplanetar.com/the-team-2024/). With my contribution and activities I became the Electrical and Communications Sub-Team Lead. Our goal was to develop a Autonomous Rover System for various task completion. With the Team I participated in European Rover Challenge (Poland, On-Site) 2022 and University Rover Challenge (USA, 2023). In this team I developed and implemented a robust power system with voltage and current sensing capabilites and Brushless DC traction system with FOC control with simpleFOC C library. Also implemented hall sensor based positional feedback system for arm autonomy. 

In my undergraduate studies for Electro-Mechanical System Design course Me and my team developed an Autonomous Arducopter based Tri-Copter having a 4 Array microphone system with flight computer to detect and identify sound pollution sources. We implemented Mavlink communication with the flight computer and ground station for smooth path planning using ROS.
